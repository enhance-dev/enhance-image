# enhance-image

**This is a pre-release version of the Enhance image component and is not intended for production usage.**

An initial pass at [the proposed Enhance image component](https://github.com/enhance-dev/enhance.dev/pull/115). This first version uses a simpler API than the one specified in the linked proposal, in order to get this component functional for internal projects. Weâ€™ll reexamine the desired API for end users at a later date.

## Usage

### Attributes
| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `src` | The path of your source image, relative to the `public` directory |
| `alt` | The alternative text for the image |
| `defaultwidth` | The default width for your generated image |
| `variant<N>` | The media query to render the variant for, and the desired width in pixels for the generated image |
| `loading` | Optional loading strategy for the image; either `'lazy'` or `'eager'` (the default option) |

Variants will be rendered as `<source>` elements in the order they are declared on the custom element. The first `source` element with a matching media query is the one that the browser will use, so be careful to enumerate your variants in the correct order.

### Example

```html
<enhance-image
  src='kitten.jpg'
  alt='A picture of a cuddly liâ€™l kitten'
  defaultwidth='400'
  variant1='(min-width: 90em) 1200'
  variant2='(min-width: 40em) 600'
  loading='lazy'
></enhance-image>
```
